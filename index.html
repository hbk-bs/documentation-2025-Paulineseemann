        <p>Reflecting on the past semester and the entire year, I’m even more surprised by what is possible to achieve in programming with my current knowledge. This semester we focused on programming with AI, which was especially exciting because the temptation to use AI was high to begin with, and with just a bit of understanding you can already accomplish a lot with its help.
With the “Teachable Machine” project, we learned how an AI can be trained and how strongly it is influenced by the input it receives. The “Text – the Universal Interface” project gave us an even deeper opportunity to understand how an AI system works. We then even created our own AI from scratch, something I could never have imagined just a few months ago.
The “Nature of Code” and “Graphic Novel” projects were also great experiences, as they allowed us to realize our own project ideas while improving our visual concepts. Looking back at all the projects we did, I’m very happy with the results of last semester and confident that I will continue to use these new digital possibilities in the future.
