        <p>We dedicated one day to our debate club and split the class into a pro and a con group beforehand to prepare arguments. On the day itself, one group began by presenting their position and main arguments, which the other group then responded to. This was followed by an engaging and sometimes rather heated debate on our topic. Even though there was no real winner or loser, both sides were more and more on the same side as the debate went on, which was already a kind of compromise from the start.</p>

        <h2 class="secondtitle">Reflection</h2>
        <p>I enjoyed the debate club more than I expected and found it helpful for all of us to discuss our concerns regarding AI and AGI, as well as the advantages, and to put them into perspective. I also participated much more than I thought I would because I appreciated the serious atmosphere of the debate and the challenge of trying to convince the other side. As always, there were stronger and weaker arguments, and I found it a bit disappointing that neither side had arguments strong enough to completely convince the other. We were probably too biased by our own opinions and could not fully identify with the pro or con side, which became increasingly apparent toward the end, perhaps also because we ran out of arguments.</p>
