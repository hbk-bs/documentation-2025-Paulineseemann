        <p>We dedicated one day to our debate club and split the class into a pro and a con group beforehand to prepare arguments. On the day itself, one group began by presenting their position and main arguments, which the other group then responded to. This was followed by an engaging and sometimes rather heated debate on our topic. Even though there was no real winner or loser, I came to the conclusion that in the end both sides were aiming for the same goal.</p>

        <h2 class="secondtitle">Reflection</h2>
        <p>I enjoyed the debate club more than I expected and found it helpful for all of us to discuss our concerns regarding AI and AGI, as well as the advantages, and to put them into perspective. I also participated much more than I thought I would because I appreciated the serious atmosphere of the debate and the challenge of trying to convince the other side.</p>
