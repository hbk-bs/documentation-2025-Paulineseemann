        <h2 class="secondtitle">Realisation</h2>
        <p>This project was specifically designed for our excursion to Amrum. Although natural systems is a broad topic, being on the island and observing nature sparked several possible ideas. In the end, I decided to focus on the system behind sunsets, as no one else was paying close attention to color systems. Besides, I simply enjoy sunsets, and we witnessed a few truly beautiful ones at the beach. After that, I started thinking about which factors a sunset could be broken down into and translated these into a sketch with the help of AI and JavaScript. The result was a system that randomly generates a new sunset each time, based on those factors. In addition, I also created an abstract sketch that uses the same factors but instead produces an image made of a network of lines and points, rather than a sunset.</p>

        <h2 class="secondtitle">Reflection</h2>
        <p>What I found especially exciting in this project was breaking down a natural system into its technical factors and then seeing it come alive again through code. I think I had the most fun with this project, and I’m really happy with how it turned out. After adjusting the sunset multiple times, it now looks smooth, and I also appreciated Fabian’s idea of adding an abstract system. The only thing I would change, if possible, would be to use a broader color palette for generating the sunsets—right now, they’re mostly limited to yellow and orange.</p>
