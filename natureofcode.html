        <h2 class="secondtitle">Realisation</h2>
        <p>This project was specifically designed for our excursion to Amrum. Although natural systems is a broad topic, being on the island and observing nature sparked several possible ideas. In the end, I decided to focus on the system behind sunsets, as no one else was paying close attention to color systems. Besides, I simply enjoy sunsets, and we witnessed a few truly beautiful ones at the beach.</p>

        <h2 class="secondtitle">Reflection</h2>
        <p>I probably had the most fun with this project and think it turned out really well. After adjusting the sunset multiple times, it now looks smooth, and I also liked Fabian’s idea of adding an abstract system.</p>
