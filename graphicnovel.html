        <p>Anna, Luca, and I didnâ€™t have a specific story in mind, so we thought it would be interesting to let AI help us create the storyline. Our only input was a description of the three of us in the classroom as a starting point. We then generated pictures step by step with ChatGPT, so the AI had to react to each image to create the content for the next one. In the end, it became a random and actually funny story of us battling a spaghetti monster in different settings. The website was designed specifically for a phone, resembling an Instagram profile, with a new story appearing containing the actual project.</p>

        <h2 class="secondtitle">Reflection</h2>
        <p>Working on the Graphic Novel project, my main responsibility was creating the website. Developing the basic concept felt relatively easy, since we had already agreed on the overall direction beforehand, and the technical implementation with AI worked smoothly. The real challenges appeared in the details, which turned out to be crucial for the overall experience. Small but important elements, such as adding a progress bar to the story, enabling users to exit the story by swiping up or down, and arranging the text in the right order and size, required much more attention than I initially expected. Another difficulty was making sure that the application worked well on mobile devices. While everything seemed fine on the computer, testing on a phone often revealed problems that had to be solved to ensure a consistent user experience. Looking back, I realized that these details are just as important as the larger design choices, and working through them gave me a deeper understanding of how much thought goes into creating a functional and engaging digital storytelling platform.</p>
