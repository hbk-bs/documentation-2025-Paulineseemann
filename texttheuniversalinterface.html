        <h2 class="secondtitle">Realisation</h2>
        <p>I decided to program an AI that generates a very cheesy lyric phrase for each picture you upload, called “Der Lyrische Bot” (the lyric bot). The idea was to have a simple, understated main page that transforms into an annoyingly pink and glittery page once the picture is loaded. Most of the work lay in the CSS, which required a lot of fine-tuning and adjustments.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, I was sick a lot during the time of this assignment, so I understand the critique that my project is still very close to Fabian’s template. If I were to do it again, I would try to create something more complex. Nevertheless, I enjoyed designing the visuals of the website and developing the idea in general.</p>
