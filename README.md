## Website Content

The **homepage (`index.html`)** contains the project title *The Archive*, a list of links to the individual project pages, a reflection text summarizing the semester and the learning process, and a footer with author information and a profile picture.

Each additional `.html` file represents one of the projects:  
1. **Teachable Machine** – training and experimenting with AI models  
2. **Nature of Code** – creative coding and generative visuals  
3. **Text the Universal Interface** – exploring AI through language  
4. **Debate Club** – project around dialogue and argument  
5. **Graphic Novel** – visual storytelling with digital tools

The **Assets** folder contains images and other media used in the project (currently a profile picture).
